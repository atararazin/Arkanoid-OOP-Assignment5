## About:
In this assignment, we continued working on the game Arkanoid, making the blocks disappear after being hit, keeping track of scores and adding multiple levels. To see the full assignment, click: https://github.com/yoavg/ioop2016/wiki/Assignment-5
## How to run the project:
Aside from the source code, I have uploaded the jar file itself, so that the final project can be played. The jar is called ex5.jar, so you download it onto your computer and enjoy.
Reminder: make sure you have a JRE on your computer in order for it to run!
