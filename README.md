# Arkanoid-OOP-Assignment5

## About:
In this assignment, we continued working on the game Arkanoid, making the blocks disappear after being hit, keeping track of scores and adding multiple levels. To see the full assignment, click: https://github.com/yoavg/ioop2016/wiki/Assignment-5
## How to run the project:
Aside from the source code, I have uploaded the JAR file itself, so that the final project can be played. The JAR is called ex5.jar, so you can simply download it onto your computer and play!

Reminder: make sure you have a JRE on your computer in order for it to run!

Have Fun!
